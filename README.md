# 🚦 ANPR & Automatic Traffic Counter and Classifier  
### Streamlit Application using YOLO, YOLOv9 & Groq API

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is an **AI-powered traffic analysis system** that combines:

- **Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR)** using **YOLO**
- **Automatic Traffic Counter & Vehicle Classifier** using **YOLOv9**
- **Streamlit-based Web Application** for easy interaction
- **Groq API** for fast inference and intelligent insights
- **Data Visualization & Analytics** from uploaded traffic videos

Users can upload traffic videos and instantly receive **vehicle counts, classifications, number plate detections, and visual analytics** through an interactive dashboard.
